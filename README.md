# Content Snippets

A tool to enable in-page editing of elements, with an adaptable content backend. Drop this into a Web page, compose with a content adapter and credentials via a server framework of your choosing, and begin editing!

### Building/Watching

Install some global dependencies, then project dependencies:

```sh
$ npm -g install bower gulp
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

Now you can build or watch the project! Built and Compiled assets will be plopped into the `dist` directory.

```sh
$ gulp build
or
$ gulp watch
or, to minify assets:
$ gulp compile
````

### Configuration
